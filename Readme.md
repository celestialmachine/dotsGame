# Dots and Boxes Game

Dots and Boxes is a game I used to play in my childhood with family and classmates.

## Descripiton

I created this game as my final project on my first python class. I was excited to work with the Pygame library as I had originally taught myself how to program on the old XNA Game Studio. It was fun to once again work with the game loop. This project is set up so the game board can be easily modified to be different sizes by altering just a few values. I might go back and continue working on this game as I keep exploring Git's functionality. If you have any questions about the project send me a message.
